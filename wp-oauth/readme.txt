wp-oauth-fiware plugin

1.Add wp-oauth folder to your plugins section of the wordpress folder structure and activate the plugin.
2. Create an application on the fiware,facebook,linkedin etc and paste the client id and secret key in your plugin.
Save the changes.

I had only added the fiware functionality in this plugin.Rest for facebook,linkedin etc was available on different links as well.It is a modified version of that plugins that are already available in the market but with the fiware authentication using Oauth.
